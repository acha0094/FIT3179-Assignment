                    Malaysia was hit the hardest in the year 2021 due to the Covid-19 virus with an alarmingly <strong>high number of positive cases</strong>. From the interactive map, we can observe how each state fared against other states in dealing with the pandemic. An important thing to note is how the state of <strong>Perlis maintained a very low number of positive cases</strong> whilst the other states suffered significantly with massive amount of outbreaks. In addition, <strong>Sarawak did well in preventing the virus from spreading</strong> as can be seen in the year 2022 whereby their <strong>number of positive cases dropped significantly</strong> compared to the previous year which <strong>other states fail to accomplish</strong>.

                <h3 class="text-box">
                    Based on the chart above, we can see the trend of infections for each state in Malaysia. Notice how there are <strong>four main waves of large infections</strong>. First wave which <strong>began in Sabah</strong> occurred <strong>between October 2020 to April 2021</strong>, which signaled the beginning of the worst to come. The next wave which is the second largest number of infections began only a few weeks after the first wave ended all the way until November 2021. Then, Malaysia encountered its <strong>largest wave of infection between February 2022 to May 2022</strong> which fortunately, <strong>did not result in significant damages</strong> as a majority of the people have already been <strong>administered with vaccination shots</strong>. Interestingly, the <strong>final wave is unique</strong> as it had <strong>only affected people within the Klang Valley</strong>, namely Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.

                    Based on the area chart above, we can see that around <strong>70 million vaccination doses have been administered</strong> to the citizens of Malaysia. Making a conservative estimate of <strong>RM38.50 per dose</strong>, the government has already spent more than <strong>RM2.7 billion to purchase various Covid-19 vaccination shots</strong>. Keep in mind that this <strong>does not include the cost of 2nd booster dose and additional vaccination doses which weren't administered</strong>. <i>Source: <a href="https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2021/12/03/covid-19-vaccines-for-malaysia-cheaper-than-belgium-pac-report/">https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2021/12/03/covid-19-vaccines-for-malaysia-cheaper-than-belgium-pac-report/</a></i>
